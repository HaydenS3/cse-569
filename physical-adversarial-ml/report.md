Hayden Schroeder - April 2024

## Adversarial Machine Learning Overview

Describe the overview of the how adversarial machine learning works. For example, what is the high-level idea of adversarial machine learning, what is common methodology and how it works, what are the assumptions, etc.

## Implementation and Experiment

Please follow the instructions in the Google doc and demonstrate each step of your implementation here. For the students who develop their own methodology, please explain your design and implementations.

## Conclusion and Limitations

Please describe your experiments during the class and your critical thinking on the limitations. For example, what do you think can be further improved in order to achieve better attacks? What are potential defenses for such attacks?
